UART Overview
=============

UART is one of the most basic asynchronous communication protocols. Also
known as RS-232, it transmits bits serially at a mutually agreed speed
without providing a clock. The speed is known as the *baud* rate, and is
typically something like 9600 baud, 115200 baud, or 10 Mbaud.

The most important characteristics are the following:

* The baud rate.

* The number of start bits, typically 1, sometimes 1.5

* The number of data bits, typically 7 or 8

* Whether a parity bit is present, and if so whether it is even parity or
  odd parity

* The number of stop bits, typically 1, sometimes 2.

Simple UART
+++++++++++

This module is a much simpler implementation of a UART that will require a whole thread for RX and deliver up to 10 Mbaud. TX could be called as a function, and hence share a thread with other functionality although this will affect the TX baud rate achieved,and this usage is not shown. 

It is fixed to 8 bits, a single start bit, no parity, and a single stop bit. All of those parameters could be changed by altering the source code. 

*The baud rate is parameterisable, but has to be a whole division of 100 MHz.* This may make it unsuitable for some applications requiring a very particular baud rate.

Note that the code is easy to understand; it comprises the example from the
XC programming manual.


Other Uarts
+++++++++++

For an implementation of multi-uart suitable for applications where more than one uart is required, the sc_multi_uart component may be a better choice.
