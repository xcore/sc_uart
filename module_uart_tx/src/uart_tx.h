 * uart_tx_set_stop_bits() and uart_tx_set_bits_per_byte(). The client should
 * provide data to the server using the uart_tx_send_byte() function.
 * \param rxd Transmitted data signal. Must be a 1-bit port.
 * \param buffer Array for buffering bytes before they are transmitted.
 * \param buffer_size Size of the \a buffer array.
 * \param baud_rate Initial baud rate.
 * \param bits Initial bits per character. Must be less than 8.
 * \param parity Type of parity to initially use. No parity bit is transmitted
 *               if \a UART_TX_PARITY_NONE is passed.
 * \param stop_bits Initial number of stop bits to transmit.
 * \param c Chanend to receive requests on, where a request is either a byte
 *          to transmit or a configuration change.
