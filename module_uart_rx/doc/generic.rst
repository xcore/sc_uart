Generic UART
============

This UART has two modules, one for RX and one for TX each of which uses one thread and is connected via channel to another thread using the UART Client API . 

The thread for the UART TX component receives data from the client via a buffer (configurable between 1 and 64 bytes). A full buffer will block the client.
  
The thread for the UART RX component receives data from external into the RX buffer (configurable between 1 and 64 bytes) which is read by the client using channel. An empty RX buffer will block the client.


Hardware Platforms
------------------

This UART is supported by all the hardware platforms from XMOS having suitable IO such as XC-1,XC-1A,XC-2,XK-1,etc and can be run on any XS1-L or XS1-G series devices.

Demo Application
-----------------

The UART functionality is demonstrated using the app_uart_back2back. This has been rpepared to run on an XK-1 board, but can easily be ported to other development boards with small modificatiosn to the code. To prepare the XK-1 board to run this app, simply connect a jumper such that ports 1A and 1B are connected (e.g. connect X0D1 and X0D0 pins on the GPIO header). Refer to the XK-1 Hardware Manual for pni positions.

The app can then be built and run. 

It will send the full set of characters from the UART TX, receive them on UART RX and then print them out in batches of 10 characters.

  
app_uart_back2back
++++++++++++++++++

It will receive via the RX component and echo via TX component.


UART RX component Overview
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The UART RX component is started using the uart_tx() function, which causes the TX server (called "_impl" in the code) to run in a while(1) loop until it receives and instruction to shut down via the channel from the client. Additionally a set of client functions are provided to fetch a byte from teh recieve buffer and to alter the baud rate, parity, bits per byte and stop bit settings. Any such action except transmitting a byte causes the RX server to terminate, the receive buffer emptied, and then restarted immediately with the new settings.

Verification
------------
   
An application app_uart_test is provided to run in XSIM using the Loopback Plugin DLL (see Tools User Guide for details) that validates the various combinations of parity, stop bit, bits-per-byte and baud rate settings. It will send data out via the UART TX component using single bit port and receive via UART RX component from another single bit port. It will check that the data matches.

The testbench is run using a python script: regression_script_UART.py. The test suites are executed as follows (after having built the application with the makefile provided:
