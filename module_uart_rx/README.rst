Generic UART Receiver
=====================

:scope: General Use
:description: Uart Receiver with the full range of baud rate (up to 115.2KBaud), parity, stop bits and bits per character support
:keywords: UART
:boards: XK-SKC-L16, XA-SK-GPIO 

This module is completely parameterisable at run time and will require whole logical core. Unlike the alternative simple/fast uart, it can operate at the standard UART baud rates, and is fully configurable with respect to bits per character, stop bits and parity.
