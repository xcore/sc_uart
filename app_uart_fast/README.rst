Simple Uart Loopback Example
============================

:scope: Example
:description: Application to demonstrate module_uart_fast_rx and module_uart_fast_tx running looped back on a single Slicekit core board
:keywords: UART, demo
:boards: XA-SKC-L2

This application instantiates both the module_uart_fast_rx and module_uart_fast_tx components looped back to one another to demonstrate basic usage. It will be necessary to setup two connections on the 0.1" testpoints on the Slicekit core board prior to running the demo. See quick start for details
