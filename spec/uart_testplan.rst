Introduction
============

This *internal* document details the testplan for testing the UART component.

Features
========

In addition to the features in the spec. These additional features are defined to aid finer granularity in the testing.

Setups
======

.. setup:: REVIEW
  :setup_time: 0

  Reviews require no setup. The review must take place preferably by
  someone other than the implementor.

.. setup:: XC1A
  :setup_time: 2

  Setup a host PC running windows with the latest development tools
  and an XC-1A dev card attached.

.. setup:: XC1A_LOOPBACK
  :setup_time: 2

  Setup a host PC running windows with the latest development tools
  and an XC-1A dev card attached with the following ports looped back
  on core 0:

        +--------+---------+
        |  1A    |   1B    |
        |  1C    |   1D    |
        |  1E    |   1F    |
        |  1G    |   1H    |
        +--------+---------+


.. setup:: SIMULATOR
  :setup_time: 1

  Setup a host PC with the latest released development tools.

Tests
=====

.. test:: sim_loopback_test
   :setup: SIMULATOR
   :configurations: BAUD_RATE_.*, BITS_PER_BYTE.* , PARITY_BITS.*, STOP_BITS_.*
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX
   :test_time: 5

   This test runs 3 uart tx/rx loopbacks at varying rates.


.. test:: hw_loopback_test
   :setup: XC1A_LOOPBACK
   :configurations: STOP_BITS_.*, PARITY_BITS_.*, BITS_PER_BYTE_.*
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX
   :test_time: 2

   This test runs 2 uart tx/rx loopbacks. The UART TX component is used to
   output data which is received by UART RX component.

.. test:: back2back_test
   :setup: XC1A
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX
   :test_time: 2   

   The virtual COM port is used to transmit data to the UART RX component.
   All data received by the UART RX component is passed to the UART TX component
   which transmits it back to the virtual COM port.

.. test:: runtime_param_change_loopback
   :setup: XC1A_LOOPBACK
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX
   :test_time: 2

   This test changes the BAUD_RATE, BITS_PER_BYTE, PARITY_BITS parameters at
   runtime using the configuration API.

.. test:: rx_buffer_overflow_exception_test
   :setup: XC1A_LOOPBACK
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX
   :test_time: 2

   This test allows the UART RX buffer to overflow and checks that an exception
   is raised.

.. test:: loopback_demo_test
   :setup: XC1A_LOOPBACK
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX, UART_DEMO_LOOPBACK
   :test_time: 2

   This test runs the loopback demo application provided with the UART
   components and checks tht data sent using the UART TX component is received
   by the UART RX component.

.. test:: back2back_demo_test
   :setup: XC1A
   :features: UART_RX, UART_TX, UART_DEMO_BACK_TO_BACK
   :test_time: 2

   This test runs the back to back demo application provided with the UART
   components and checks tht data sent to the UART RX component is echoed
   by the UART RX component.
