:Maintainer:  Dan Wilkinson (github: djpwilk)

Key Features
============

Generic UART
------------

module_uart_rx
module_uart_tx

   * Inline library that assumes RX and TX in separate threads
   * Baud Rates up to 115.2K, any combination of bits per byte, parity, stop bits
   * configurable buffer sizes  
   * An XSIM testbench and demo appliction for the XK-1A is included.

Simple/Fast UART
----------------

module_uart_fast_rx
module_uart_fast_tx

   * Needs thread for transmission and another for reception
   * Fixed to 8 bits per byte, single start bit, no parity, single stop bit. 
   * All of these parameters can be changed by editing the module. 
   * The baud rate is parameterisable, but has to be a whole division of 100 MHz.
   * 10 MBaud is achievable in a 100 MIPS thread
   * Includes an XK-1A demo application
